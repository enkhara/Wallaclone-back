## PRIVATE ZONE

All calls to the API of the private zone will need to incorporate the valid token JWT (token that has not expired) in the header of the request (Headers, key field: Authorization, in value we will put the token) to be able to make the request URL. 
This token will be obtained in the call to the User Login. 

### POST /apiv1/advertisements 

You'll create a new ad in your ad collection (advertisements).
To test it we go to the POSTMAN application, create a new tab, select the POST method and add the url: <http://localhost:3001/apiv1/advertisements>

In Headers, we have to fill in the value of the key "Authorization" the valid token.
We select the selector where we are going to pass the information, in this case, in the body and format of the information: form-data. 
We fill in the fields in the key of each field of our ad scheme and insert in the value of each field the value we want to create. 
And then, we press the SEND button in the Postman app. Postman gives us the answer with a status 201 as we have established in our api, so the new ad has been created in the database correctly.
